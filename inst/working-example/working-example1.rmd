```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Load the library and look at the data

```{r}
library(basket)

# Load the vemurafinib data for analysis.
data(vemu_wide)
vemu_wide
```

# Fit the model
```{r}
# Fit the MEM model using Empirical Bayes.
m <- mem_empirical_bayes(responses = vemu_wide$responders, 
                         size = vemu_wide$evaluable,
                         name = vemu_wide$baskets)
```

# Plot the posteriors
```{r}
# Plot the response rate of each basket.
plot(m)
```

# Questions

1. What is CDF? It doesn't look like a cumulative density function.
2. What is HPD?
3. Which information should be shown when we print an exchangeability model? Maybe the following:
    - Ratio of basket responders to basket size
    - ESS
    - number responses per basket
    - size of each basket
    - mean estimate
    - median estimate
