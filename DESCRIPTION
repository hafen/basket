Description: Implemention of multisource exchangeability models for Bayesian analyses of 
   prespecified subgroups arising in the context of basket trial design and monitoring. 
   The R `basket` package facilitates implementation of the binary, symmetric multi-source
   exchangeability model (MEM) with posterior inference arising from both exact computation 
   and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Analysis output includes full posterior samples as 
   well as posterior probabilities, highest posterior density (HPD) interval boundaries, 
  effective sample sizes (ESS), mean and median estimations, posterior exchangeability 
  probability matrices, and maximum a posteriori MEMs.In addition to providing "basketwise" analyses, 
  the package includes similar calculations for "clusterwise" analyses for which 
  subgroups are combined into meta-baskets, or clusters, using graphical clustering algorithms that 
  treat the posterior exchangeability probabilities as edge weights. In addition 
  plotting tools are provided to visualize basket and cluster densities as well as their exchangeability.
