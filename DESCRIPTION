Description: Implemention of multisource exchangeability models for basket trial design 
  and monitoring. The R `basket` package provides for the designs and analysis of basket 
  trials for [multi-source exchangeability models (MEM)], which allows arms to "share" power 
  with similar arms in a trial. The package is intended to perform the exact or MCMC 
  computation of the operating characteristics of different scenarios. Calculations derived 
  from these analyses include the posterior probabilities, HPD boundaries, 
  effective sample sizes (ESS), mean and median estimations can be calculated with this package 
  using the MEM method. Along with providing "basketwise" analyses, the package includes similar calculations for "clusterwise" analyses where a cluster a set of similar baskets. In addition 
  plotting tools are provided to visualize basket and cluster density as well as their exchangeability.
